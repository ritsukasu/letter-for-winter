## ✨ Features
* **Interactive Envelope:** A sliding silk-textured envelope that reveals a personal letter.
* **Vinyl Player:** A custom-styled music widget with a spinning vinyl animation made using javascript.

* **Message Text Field:** An integrated contact form—any messages sent through the text area are delivered straight to my email.
  
## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure the music files (e.g., `music1.mp3`) are in the root folder.
3. Make sure `winterlogo.png`, `winter.png`, and `winterlogo.png` are present.
4. **Email Integration:** Ensure the form backend (like Formspree or a custom script) is configured with your email address to receive messages. I suggest EmailJs for customization.
5. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser.

## 🛠️ Customization
To change the music playlist, update the `tracks` array in the JavaScript file:
```javascript
const tracks = [
    { name: "Song Name", src: "your-file.mp3" },
];
